# Pathfinder
This project was my first major undertaking in the field, undertaken with minimal prior knowledge, and it played a crucial role in guiding me towards Computer Engineering. I focused on studying artificial intelligence, delving into its mechanics and ethical implications. I also developed a Windows application using C++.

The application allowed users to create a "scenario" with obstacles, and the AI I designed was tasked with finding the shortest path between two points within that scenario. Despite my initial lack of experience, the project received an outstanding grade and earned recognition at the "Fòrum de Treballs de Recerca del Baix Montseny," as well as an honorary mention at the MTG (Mercat Tecnológic de Granollers).

This project reaffirmed my passion for computer science and demonstrated my ability to contribute meaningfully to the field, even as I was just starting out. I’m excited to continue expanding my skills in Computer Engineering.
